<div align="center"> it's so honestly funny when people are making fun of me for "copying" despite having 0 interest on "copying" them, i legit went on a lockdown on the party island for a long time, my close friends in our party knows it well when they go on. like it's even not that close to your coloring style? it won't be my fault if the website that i was using gave me that exact color as yours.. so were claiming colors now too??.. i've been shading and tinting experiencing for years now and i still think that SOME people still gets "mad" at me for having the same tinting or a certain color that SOME of their ponies have even though i never seen them around nor ever seen anyone around for YEARS their friends probably tells them i suppose?? if your gonna complain that we have the same accessories or hair style then complain to pony town to add more rather than adding new objects/materials?? some of y'all need to calm down seriously, this is probably another reason why people doesn't wanna interact with this certain person that gets blamed for "copying" even tho they never had intentions in the first place? some gets scared of asking for inspo because they're afraid that some of y'all would bite.
<div align="center"> its not that im mad or anything its just fr so unmotivating to not go around in public again to prove that i don't copy nor had intensions in the first place
