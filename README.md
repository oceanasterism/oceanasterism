AGE BOUNDARIES / LIMIT! below 14 plz dni or DON'T BE WEIRD because ill cry if you do. I GUESS. we can talk normally and be friends/oomfs but that's it!! no closure plzz thx.

c+h freely, I'm always semi-afk. Whispers is preferred if you want to talk, my public chat can be off sometimes. i mostly chat through my party members

im usually seen above market or near bsd area on the pine tree with rock, i honestly don't know why i like to stay on that particular spot not unless my friends drags me or i drag them elsewhere or my friends get overwhelmed by the amount of ponies and make their screen lag.

i maybe awake till 5am GMT+8 i may sleep early depending if i have to wake up early for school or some important things to do
